# Adidas-Dashboard
Following Kenji Explains YouTube tutorial on how to create an Interactive Sales Dashboard. The dataset was sourced from Kenji Explains
Created a sales dashboard for adidas on Excel that's going to dynamically update based on the filters on the side which will allow us to select specific years, regions, products and more. 
Firstly, we went over the dataset and created pivot tables to show us the relevant data. 
Second, we created the right charts and visuals for the dashboard.
Then, design of the actual dashboard began from scratch.
And lasty placed everything together by dynamically linking the visuals and making them an interactive dashboard.
